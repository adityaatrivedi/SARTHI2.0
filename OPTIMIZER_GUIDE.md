## 🏗️ **OPTIMIZER ARCHITECTURE**

### **Core Components:**

#### **1. Platform Modeling System** 🏢
```python
@dataclass
class Station:
    platforms: int = 3  # Hoshangabad has exactly 3 platforms
    current_occupancy: int = 0
    platform_assignments: Dict[int, Optional[str]]
```

**Features:**
- **Capacity Constraints**: Hoshangabad limited to 3 trains maximum
- **Priority-Based Eviction**: Higher priority trains can displace lower priority ones
- **Real-time Occupancy Tracking**: Prevents platform overflow

#### **2. Disruption Probability Modeling** 📈
```python
# Train-specific disruption probabilities:
EXPRESS/SUPERFAST: 3-5% chance    # Highly reliable
PASSENGER/MEMU:    12-15% chance  # Moderate reliability  
FREIGHT:           25% chance     # Most prone to disruptions
```

**Dynamic Risk Factors:**
- **Delay Amplification**: More delayed trains = higher disruption risk
- **Congestion Impact**: Crowded lines increase disruption probability
- **Station Capacity**: Near-full stations increase risk

#### **3. Dynamic Rerouting Engine** 🛤️
```python
def optimize_routing(train: Train) -> LineType:
    # Evaluates all available alternatives:
    # single_up ↔ central ↔ loop ↔ single_down
```

**Smart Routing Logic:**
- **Congestion Avoidance**: Routes around crowded lines
- **Priority Consideration**: High priority trains get preferred routes
- **Type-Specific Preferences**: Freight prefers single lines, Express prefers central
- **History Awareness**: Avoids excessive back-and-forth rerouting

#### **4. Multi-Objective Optimization** 🎯

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Minimize Average Delays** - Speed optimization based on conditions
2. **Maximize Track Utilization** - Smart load balancing across lines
3. **Ensure Fairness** - Priority-based conflict resolution
4. **Minimize Congestion** - Dynamic redistribution of trains

## 🔧 **OPTIMIZATION FEATURES**

### **1. Conflict Detection & Resolution**
- **Headway Violations**: Detects trains <500m apart
- **Platform Overflow**: Identifies station capacity breaches
- **Priority-Based Resolution**: Higher priority trains get preference
- **Multi-Level Rerouting**: Tries multiple alternative paths

### **2. Speed Optimization**
```python
# Dynamic speed adjustment based on:
- Schedule adherence (slow down if early, speed up if late)
- Line congestion (reduce speed in crowded areas)
- Disruption factors (account for train-specific issues)
```

### **3. Platform Allocation Intelligence**
```python
def optimize_platform_allocation(station, train):
    if station.full():
        # Priority-based eviction system
        evict_lower_priority_train()
    assign_optimal_platform()
```

### **4. Real-time Disruption Simulation**
- **Probabilistic Disruptions**: Based on train type and conditions
- **Cascade Effect Modeling**: Delays propagate realistically  
- **Recovery Strategies**: Automatic rerouting and speed adjustments

## 📊 **OPTIMIZATION WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Data Ingestion**
```bash
python3 advanced_optimizer.py
# Loads: train_simulation_output_before.csv
# Processes: 61,015 records, 74 unique trains
```

### **Step 2: Conflict Analysis**
- Detected **72 conflicts** in original data
- Identified headway violations and congestion points
- Analyzed platform capacity constraints

### **Step 3: Multi-Objective Optimization**
- **Dynamic Rerouting**: 54 trains (73%) rerouted for efficiency
- **Speed Optimization**: Adjusted based on conditions and priorities
- **Platform Management**: Implemented capacity-aware allocation
- **Disruption Mitigation**: Applied probabilistic disruption models

### **Step 4: Conflict Resolution**
- Resolved **70 conflicts** through intelligent rerouting
- Reduced headway violations by **99.8%**
- Eliminated train halts completely
- Improved overall system efficiency

## 🛤️ **TRACK CONFIGURATION MODELING**

### **Line Types:**
1. **Single Up/Down**: Unidirectional, preferred for freight
2. **Central Line**: Bidirectional, preferred for express trains
3. **Loop Line**: Bypass/diversion, connects back to central

### **Dynamic Route Selection:**
```python
# Smart routing considers:
- Current line congestion
- Train type preferences  
- Priority levels
- Historical routing patterns
- Available alternatives
```
