timestamp, train_id, train_type, line, position_m, speed_kmph, station, event, delay_minutes
```

### Sample Data Row
```csv
1900-01-01 00:00:00,PA-074,Passenger,single_up,466,56,,moving,131
```

### Data Format Details
- **timestamp**: Simulation time
- **train_id**: Unique train identifier (e.g., PA-074, SU-035)
- **train_type**: Type of train (Passenger, Express, Superfast, MEMU, Mail, Freight)
- **line**: Track line (single_up, single_down, central, etc.)
- **position_m**: Train position in meters
- **speed_kmph**: Train speed in km/h
- **station**: Station name (can be empty)
- **event**: Train status (moving, halted, rerouted, scheduled)
- **delay_minutes**: Delay in minutes

## üìä Dashboard Sections

### 1. Theme & Data Upload
- **Theme toggle** - Light/Dark mode switcher at top of sidebar
- **Theme indicator** - Shows current theme (‚òÄÔ∏è Light Mode / üåô Dark Mode)
- **Sidebar file uploaders** for before/after CSV files
- **Real-time validation** with error messaging
- **Sample data format** display for guidance

### 2. KPI Overview
- **Color-coded metrics** (Green=improved, Red=worsened, Gray=unchanged)
- **Percentage changes** with directional arrows
- **Side-by-side comparison** layout

### 3. Comparative Charts
- **Interactive Plotly visualizations**
- **Before/after overlays** for easy comparison
- **Drill-down capabilities** with hover details

### 4. Track Visualization
- **Real-time track layout** showing train positions
- **Safety compliance markers** (red/green system)
- **Interactive train details** on hover

### 5. Export & Reporting
- **One-click CSV downloads** for reports
- **Audit trail access** with complete history
- **Automated insights** with actionable recommendations

## üìà Metrics Calculation

### Delay Analysis
- Trains with >5 minutes delay from scheduled time
- Calculated as percentage of total trains
- Lower percentages indicate better performance

### Headway Compliance
- Distance between consecutive trains measured in meters
- Safety rule: minimum 500m separation required
- Violations tracked and highlighted in red

### Congestion Analysis
- Station-wise train count per hour
- Heatmap visualization showing peak times
- Platform utilization across different periods

### Route Optimization
- Track rerouting based on line changes and rerouted events
- Percentage of trains that changed their original line/route
- Uses 'rerouted' event type and line switching analysis

## üîç Key Insights Generation

The dashboard automatically generates intelligent insights such as:
- "Optimization reduced headway violations by 45% and improved average delays by 2.3 minutes"
- "Congestion at Hoshangabad remains high due to limited platforms"
- Recommendations for further improvements

## üìù Audit Trail

Every analysis run is logged with:
- **Timestamp** of analysis
- **Source files** used
- **Before/after metrics** with percentage changes
- **Improvement direction** (Improved/Worsened/Unchanged)
- **Export capability** for compliance tracking

## üö¶ Usage Guidelines

### Data Quality
- Ensure timestamp consistency across both files
- Validate train IDs are consistent between before/after datasets
- Check for missing or null values in critical columns

### Performance Tips
- For large datasets (>100k rows), consider sampling for initial analysis
- Use date filtering to focus on specific time periods
- Close unused browser tabs to free up memory

### Best Practices
- Always backup original data files before transformation
- Review audit trail regularly for compliance tracking
- Export reports after each significant analysis
- Use meaningful file names with timestamps

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Data Format Issues**: Use `data_transformer.py` to convert data
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce dataset size or increase system RAM
4. **Port Conflicts**: Change port in run script if 8501 is busy

### Support
For technical issues or feature requests, check the audit trail logs for error details and ensure all dependencies are properly installed.
